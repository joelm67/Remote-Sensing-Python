        "Now that we learned about some of the basic concepts of Python as well as importaing libraries and arrays, let's dive in and start doing image processing.  For this part we are going to do several things.  We are going to import the GDAL library so that we can use it to read and manipulate remotely sensed imagery in geospatial context.  Second we are going to use Numpy capabilities to calculate NDVI and write the file back to the disk using GDAL that can be downloaded.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, lets learn a bit more about importing libraries.  So far, we imported libraries using a simple *import xxxxxx from xx* syntax.  This works because the libraries (Numpy, matplotlib etc) we used so far are common libraries that our Python language knows how to find.  However, the GDAL library we will now import is more *exotic* - meaning that we need to tell our Python interpreter how to find it.  This is done by interacting with the operating system (OS)! \n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook we are working in is a Jupyter notebook that lives on top of a linux virtual machine.  You can think of it as a computer in the cloud with a linux operating system.  The first thing we need to do is to check if the operating system has any updates - just like how you would check for updates for your smart phone.  The `!apt update` and the `!apt upgrade` does that. Next, we are going to install gdal tools.  The line including `!apt install gdal-bin python-gdal python3-gdal` does that.  Note that to interact with the OS, we are using the `!` character (escape character) to escape to the OS! Finally, now that our Python interpreter knows how to find GDAL, we can import it as we import other common libraries.  **Warning: this could take a bit!**"
